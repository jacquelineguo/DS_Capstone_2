This is a data science capstone project of Springboard Data Science Bootcamp Machine Learning Track

Introduction: 
Right now we are in a computer based society. Microsoft Windows is one of the most popular computers for people to use. However, once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways. Thus we could predict if the computer will soon be hit with malware, we can reduce the risk of malware infection.
Computer services companies such as Microsoft or any windows users would like to apply this prediction to their system to keep their user’s using experience safe. Most people or companies who use computers would care as well, for example, institutions like financial service companies or banks would love to keep their company information safe.

Dataset: 
Dataset is from Microsoft of Kaggle competition. The size of the data is 7.89 GB with 167 columns and 8921483 rows. Microsoft provides one training dataset and one testing dataset which include the information about product name, different system versions, or different engine versions. This information could help us to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine.

I have selected three models to perform malware detection prediction which are: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
